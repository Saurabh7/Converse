client.py was my attempt to make a p2p chat client using twisted and pyqt ,supporting multiple sessions.
I wanted to save the connected users as xml file and then assign each user as a graph vertex to run some elementary graph algorithms.Its not quite complete and lacks error handling,but still runs as a demo.
